Coding Python using Artificial Intelligence

## Keywords

### Pre-compilation
Pre-compilation is the process of converting each element of an instruction (line of code)
into a "Token", which contains all the information required for that element to be compiled 
into Python3 code.

Pre-compiled pieces of code are stringified instructions written in a psuedo language resembling  statically typed Python. This code can be compiled using the built-in compiler to generate noramal,
executable Python3 code.

### Token
A token is a stringified descriptor of an instruction element.
